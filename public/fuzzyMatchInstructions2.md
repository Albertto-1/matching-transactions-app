Write another function or update your previous function to still be able to match the transactions with their most likely orders, allowing/handling these mistakes as best you can. You can use your own judgement about what constitutes a “likely match”, but please explain it.
If external libraries would be useful, feel free to use them. It's best to have a working function here, but if you need to, you can make up imaginary functions/libraries to call. They should be realistic helper functions that you would expect to find in a library or online service, and you should describe clearly what the functions do / return (it should be limited in scope rather than a drop-in replacement for this problem).
